# üí∂Finance Predictor App

## üìã Overview
The Finance Predictor App is designed to predict asset prices (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) using machine learning models specifically tailored for time series analysis, such as Prophet and ARIMA. Users can input a ticker symbol to explore historical financial data, ask AI for insights, or forecast future prices. The app integrates these models to provide financial insights through interactive charts and forecast accuracy metrics.
