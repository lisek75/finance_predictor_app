        The **Finance Predictor App** is designed to predict asset prices (stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc.) using **machine learning models** 
        specifically tailored for **time series analysis**, such as **Prophet** and **ARIMA**. 
        Users can input a **ticker symbol** to explore **historical financial data**, ask **AI for insights**, or **forecast future prices**. 
        The app integrates these models to provide financial insights through **interactive charts** and **forecast accuracy metrics**.
        
        **Futures and options** are not supported in this version of the app because they involve short-term contracts and lack enough long-term historical data for reliable forecasting. 
        These instruments typically expire in days or months, making it difficult to predict trends over a year, which is the minimum forecast period in the app. 
        Stocks and cryptocurrencies, with more extensive historical data, are better suited for long-term forecasting models.
